# Goals

* Create the next dashboard iteration
* Help instructors to answer key questions:
  * Who are my students? (General demographics)
  * What is the overall structure of my course?
  * How are students engaging with my videos?
  * How are students performing on the problems?
  * How are students interacting with the forums?

# How does our usability testing work?

![usability testing workflow](./img/loop.png)

---
# Testing Protocol

###  1. Pre-test Question

- What kind of information about student learning do you want to get and have no access to now?

### 2. Scavenger Hunt

![Scavenger hunt Questions](./img/scavenger_hunt_questions.png)

### 3. Post-test Questions

- What was confusing or frustrating about using or interpreting the dashboard?
- What information, if any, seemed particularly useful to you?
- What did you want to know more about?
---
# Excerpts from Instructor Feedback

# How do we deal with hundreds of requirements from instructors?

![Product Management Table](./img/cartoon.jpg)

Create a "universal remote control" to satisfy everyone's need ï¼Ÿ

No.

###  We mainly targeted six key pain points that have been mentioned a couple of times by instructors.

---
# Instructor Pain Point 1: **Not enough interactivity**

![pain point 1](./img/p1.png)


---
# Instructor Pain Point 2: **Unclear display of overview engagement Eiffel Tower graph**

![pain point 2](./img/p2.png)


---
# Instructor Pain Point 3: **Lack of guidance for analytics of problem sets**

![pain point 3](./img/p3.png)

---
# Instructor Pain Point 4:**Lack of in-depth understanding of student video watching behavior**

![pain point 4](./img/p4.png)

---
# Instructor Pain Point 5: **No access to forum discussion data**

![pain point 5](./img/p5.png)

---
# Instructor Pain Point 6: **Lack of information about which URLs are clicked**

![pain point 6](./img/p6.png)

# Why Reproducibility Matters

 - UBC has dozens of MOOCs
 - Other universities may adopt this dashboard
 - Broken dashboards don't get used

---

# Course Population

# Project Encapsulation

- All dependencies must be explicit

![Deployment Structure](./../img/deployment_structure.png)

# Future of the project

* Deploy for all UBC courses
* Submit for publication/CRAN
* Present at edX conference in November
* Hopefully, deploy for all edX courses
