# Main Goals

#### Help instructors to answer key questions:
  * Who are my students? (General demographics)
  * What is the overall structure of my course?
  * How are students engaging with my videos?
  * How are students performing on the problems?
  * How are students interacting with the forums?

#### Have instructors use our dashboard
  * Easily deployable
  * Scalable
  * Generalize to a wide variety of courses and instructors

???
* Using shiny to finish MVP for testing
