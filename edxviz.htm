# Introduction
![MOOC Intro](./..img/intro_and_goals/mooc_intro.jpg)

---

# Goals
* Create the next dashboard iteration
* Help instructors to answer key questions:
* Who are my students? (General demographics)
* What is the overall structure of my course?
* How are students engaging with my videos?
* How are students performing on the problems?
* How are students interacting with the forums?

# Why Reproducibility Matters

 - UBC has dozens of MOOCs
 - Other universities may adopt this dashboard
 - Broken dashboards don't get used
